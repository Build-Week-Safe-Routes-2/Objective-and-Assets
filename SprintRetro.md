## Description Rationale

The key in any agile development process is _constant improvement_. As we look back at the end of an iteration we can improve in the following iteration. During Labs/Build Week sprint weeks we have conversations as individuals and often discuss how to improve in 1:1s with team members. During a retrospective meeting we can meet to discuss what happened, what we learned, what went well and what we can do moving forward.

Objectives:

- Team Leads should be able to set the agenda for a retrospective meeting
- Team Leads should be able to effectively lead a retrospective and help the team improve

## Introduction

A retrospective is the best way to collaborate and find out how the sprint went for the team. It's the platform in Agile that allows you as a team to hearing one another after a unit of work has been completed. At Lambda we're going to be doing retrospectives for each week in Lambda Labs / Build Week as well as:

### Learn to set the agenda for a retrospective meeting

As the Team Leader, it will be up to you to set the stage for the meeting. You’ll want to discuss with the team how they can:

- Embrace the goal of continuous improvement.
- Not make or take things personal.
- Even distribution of input, everyone should listen and share.
- Clarity of the window of time (just the last week, the full 5 weeks).
- Focus on removing `blame`, and only on how things can improve.

## The retrospective agenda is typically 4 items:

- What happened?
- What did we learn?
- What did we do well?
- What should we have done better?
- Next steps

### What happened?

Often an objective view of what happened during the period can level-set the conversation. Did you deliver? What did you deliver? Did you fail a specific sprint challenge? What part did you fail to accomplish? Did you build out the features? What features did you successfully build? Objectively reviewing the activity of the period is very useful.

### What did we learn?

Ultimately Labs/Build Week is a learning opportunity. Help the team focus on what they learned. Help them pull out the experiences and opportunities that were unique to Labs/Build Week. Even when the outcome was failure, we have an opportunity to learn.

### What did we do well?

It’s good to talk about what went well _before_ we get into what could be improved. Often teams spend so much time in retrospective focused on the negative that the meeting becomes an emotional burden. Let people submit multiple ideas in a thread or slack message. Add them to a document.

### What should we have done better?

This should not be blame. It should not be “so and so should have”. This is an opportunity to describe what the team can improve. Same pattern as “What did we do well?”. Let people submit ideas in a thread or Slack message. Add them to a document.

### Next Steps

Having identified what didn’t go so well, what concrete actions can the team take to improve those things? As a team discuss things that could be done to fix the “What should we have done better” or to make “What did we do well” happen even more. Add them to a document.

## Challenge

Discuss as a group how this may go. What might go well for teams? What might be a challenge? What can we do to help the agenda flow smoothly?

The meeting needs to flow efficiently and be done in about 30-40 minutes. It shouldn’t be a full hour, and definitely not longer. If the meeting is an effective use of time, teams will want to do them regularly. If the meeting is a ritual with no value, engineers will complain endlessly.

You are the FACILITATOR of this meeting. Lead it out, but let them contribute all the content.

Help the team succeed at each agenda item. Come to the meeting having prepared some thoughts for each item. Share the agenda beforehand with the team and encourage them to do the same.
